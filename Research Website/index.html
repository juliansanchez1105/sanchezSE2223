                    <p class="lead overview-font" id="ovPadLeft">Around the world, 2.8 billion people live with water scarcity. 
                        Of those, 1.2 billion people live with water scarcity caused by the physical lack of nearby water sources.
                         Furthermore, many people lack clean, sanitary water for purposes of drinking, sanitation, and irrigation.
                          The solutions being implemented now are insufficient to supply the ever-growing demand for water due to 
                          population growth. These solutions include infrastructure, wells, rainwater harvesting, and fog/dew harvesting
                          , among others. Infrastructure and wells are expensive, take a long time to construct, and wells need an 
                          underground water source to draw from. This strictly limits where these can be built and how long it will
                           take to acquire funding and construction. Rainwater, fog, and dew collection systems are also highly 
                           inconsistent, regional, and are intensely affected by air pollution. The conditions of the atmosphere 
                           can lead to low yields and harmful metals in the water.</p>

                    <h1 id="ovPadRight">Rationale</h1>
                    <p class="lead overview-font" id="ovPadRight">The solution proposed involves the use of transpiration. 
                        Transpiration is the mechanism by which plants release water vapor to serve various purposes including 
                        excreting waste, heat release, and drawing water up the xylem. Much of this water is “wasted” in trees to 
                        create enough pressure to conduct the water up through such a tall tube.  A typical tree under typical 
                        conditions will transpire approximately 90% of the water it draws up. This transpired water has come from
                         the ground and been filtered through the plant's systems. The transpired water vapor is clean and free of
                          contaminants due to the tree’s xylem acting as a filter. The use of trees could alleviate the problem because
                           trees act as natural filters, are already integrated into the ground, and are fairly common around 
                           the world. This means that the target areas will have access to a supplementary source of water very 
                           close to where they live. In India, for example, since their water scarcity derives from a lack of 
                           sanitation, the trees have more water available and thus can transpire more. This means that the device
                            will be more effective in those areas. However, in areas without large sources of water, trees still 
                            require water to survive, meaning that the dispersed water in the soil where the trees are drinking from
                             can be used. The device would be less effective, though, because plants transpire less the less hydrated
                              the soil is.</p>
